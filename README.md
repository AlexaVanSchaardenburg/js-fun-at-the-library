# JS Fun in the Library

## Overview

In this project I was given a set of tests that I needed to wrtie JavaScript code to pass. This proejct allowed me to practice writing code to solve problems and helped me develop problem solving skills for furutre projects. 

## Learning goals

  - Understand what JavaScript primitives are, and how/when to use them
  - Understand how to declare variables and assign data to them
  - Practice using objects and arrays

## Setup

  My work can be viewed by forking and cloning this project OR by viweing it through GitHub.
  
  The project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/library.html).
